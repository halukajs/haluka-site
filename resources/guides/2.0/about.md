Haluka is a Node.js MVC application development framework for rapid development. It is a **"batteries included"** framework, offering an extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools for rapid application development so that business needs and problems can be focused over deciding on which package to use.


## Getting Started

A good knowledge of JavaScript is enough to get started with Haluka, but having knowlegde of Node.JS and **asynchronous** (non-blocking) programming comes in handy. There aren't any other strict prequisites to use Haluka. It is easy to take-off.

If you are new to Javascript, you might consider learning JavaScript before preceeding to prevent yourself from torture. You may go through [guide provided by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript) to get started on JavaScript.


## Building Blocks

Haluka consists of wide range of service providers and these service providers are the building blocks of Haluka applications. They are technically a module or package with Haluka flavouring over them to fit in with Haluka applications.

Service providers include Database, Config, Authentication, etc.
